# PROJECT : ALUMNI PROFILE MATCHING

**Motivation**: 
Itâ€™s always good to reach out to people with similar interests and backgrounds. Usually, we only reach out to alumni who are introduced during special events or seminars. This could overwhelm the alumni or they might not answer all the current students' questions. For suppose, if there are 2 students - one with a Finance background with several years of experience and the other with a Computer Science background with no/little experience. Alumni with relative or similar backgrounds can make better suggestions. This project aims to pick the top 5 similar alumni profiles for each current student to whom they can reach out by determining the similarity scores for the students and the alumni.
